# Software Delivery and Development - Definitions

__Development__ - programming the chain of actions and conditions in order to achieve the expected system reactions upon the defined inputs.

__Delivery__ - programming the chain of actions and conditions in order to cost and time effectively satisfy the end customer needs, so to generate maximum revenue

# Software Delivery and Development - Side by side

.left-column[ ### Development
* Strives to perfection
* Is a good place for mental fights
* The result fulfills only your and your mama demands
* Expected to work on your local environment
]
.right-column[ ### Delivery
* Strives to be delivered on-time
* Is a good place for collaboration
* The result fulfills a demand of thousands people
* Needs an __infrastructure__ in order to work

# Delivery Workflow for various app types

1. Desktop App
2. Mobile App
3. Website
4. Public facing API
5. The service with UI, API, and other features.

---
class: dp-regular

# Software Delivery - Build step

* Construction of something that has an observable and tangible result.
* Process of converting source code files into standalone software artifact(s) that can be run on a computer. Produce artifacts.

### Functions of the Build step:

* Version control/Tagging.
* Code qualit check.
* Compilation/Translation of th esource code into executable instructions.
---
class: dp-regular

# Delivery Workflow - Build Artifacts per Application type

1. __Desktop App__ - EXE or MSI files.
2. __Mobile App__ - .app (iOS) or .apk (Android) bundles.
3. __Website__ - a folder with files or archive. Might contain configuration.
4. __Public facing API__ - a folder with files or archive. Might contain configuration.
5. __The service with UI, API, and other features__ - a folder with files or archive.

# Hosting Infrastructure for Desktop App

1. Communicates with an "outside world" via Internet.
2. All configuration is packed along with the main app file.
3. Distribution server - main source for end users to download the app from.
4. Runs on End User's local environment. Extremely versatile envs, no control for the app.

# Delivery Workflow - Common Best Practices

* All code shoul be under Version Control System (VCS). No exeptions.
* At least two environments: Staging and Production.

# Demo: Manual app deployment from the ground up

---
class: dp-regular

# What we'll be doing:

1. Infrastructure:
    1. Server for UI app.
    2. Server for API.
    3. DB Server.
    4. Access to manage infrastructure
2. Environment configuration:
    1. Web server, corresponding packages and config for UI app.
    2. API server, environment and app-level configs for API.
    3. DB instance set up and config.
3. Network configurration and Integration testing.


Note: We'll be using GCP for our infrastructure for this particular example.

# UI Server - Infrastructure

1. Spin up `n1-standard-1` Virtual Machine in GCP (Name: code-delivery-ui; Region: europe-west1; Boot Disk - Ubuntu 19.04; Firewall - Allow HTTP traffic)
2. Configure SSH access there to be able to manage the server. Generate SSH key, then add to Compute Engine > Metadata > SSH Keys, test connection:

    ```sh
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "ansible"
    cat ~/.ssh/ansible.pub | pbcopy

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible ansible@{public-ip}
    ```

Note: Usually it takes months to get the server up and running with Bare Metal.
---

# UI Server - Environment configuration. NGINX installation

* Greating NGINX user, allowing SSH for it:

```sh
sudo adduser nginx
sudo usermod -aG sudo nginx

sudo rsync --archive --chown=nginx:nginx ~/.ssh /home/nginx/
```

* SSH as nginx user:
```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible nginx@{public-ip}
```

---
class: dp-regular

# UI Server - Environment configuration. NGINX installation

* Install NGINX:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx

sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP' // Adding firewall rule.
```

* Test NGINX installation by opening http://{public-ip}/ in the browser.

---
class: dp-regular

# UI Server - Environment configuration. App deployment

* Build the app:

```sh
npm install && npm run build:prod:en
```
* Upload the build to the server:

```sh
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/html // While SSHd to the server,
                                        // Change the web folder owner
rsync -avz -e 'ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible' dist/browser/ nginx@35.240.97.91:/var/www/html
```
* Test the deployment by opening http://{public-ip}/ in the browser.

# API Server - Infrastructure

# API Server - Environment configuration. NodeJS installation.

NodeJS is an engine to run our API. Will not work without it:
```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.3.8/install.sh | bash //NVM
source ~/.profile
nvm ls-remote | grep -i "latest lts"

nvm install v10.16.3
nvm install v4.9.1 // For env inconsistency demo
```

---
class: dp-regular

# API Server - Environment configuration. App deployment.

* Make a Build

```sh
npm install && npm run build
```

* Upload the build to the server:

```sh
rsync -avz -e 'ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible' package.json nginx@{public-ip}:/home/nginx/code-delivery-api
rsync -avz -e 'ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible' dist nginx@{public-ip}:/home/nginx/code-delivery-api
```
---
class: dp-regular

# API Server - Environment configuration. App deployment.

* Run the application (Uses the DB from the cloud)

```sh
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://jofuofbd:j9JYJTeMXTYHsbzYUfwjKNGuKnqEWZJl@dumbo.db.elephantsql.com:5432/jofuofbd
npm i && npm run start
```

* Test locally - Works!

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/
```
---
class: dp-regular

# API Server - Public access.

In order to access our API via Internet, we need to set up a Reverse Proxy to route our HTTP calls from outside to localhost.
Let's use NGINX for this purpose.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

---
class: dp-regular

# API Server - Public access.

```config
server {
    ...
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
    ...
    }
```
---
class: dp-regular

# API Server - Public access.

```sh
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
npm i && npm run start // Restart the application
```

* Test our API:

```sh
curl http://{public-ip}/ //Should return Hello World!
```

# Manual app deployment - Pros and Cons

* Pros:
    * No Pros! If you think there are, you wrong!!!
    * There's no excuse to deploy that way in a modern world!

* Cons:
    * Error-prone because of a ton of manual steps.
    * Takes time. A lot!
    * People owns expertize, not machines.
    * Hard to document: UI and OS envs are subject to shange;
    * Edge-cases.
